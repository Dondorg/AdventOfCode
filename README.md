# AdventOfCode

A collection of my solutions to the AoC challenges. I am using these problems to become more familiar with Python

I don't claim to find the most brilliant or most cutting-edge efficient solutions. My rules of thumb are:
* Make the intent of the code as clear as possible
* Optimize only when necessary

Feel free to laugh at my attempts and feel equally free to teach me tips and tricks =]
